About The Project
"Application Name           = Wafer Faultdetection"

"What'a wafer and its use   = Wafer was a semiconducting meterial used in major of electronic devices in the world" 

"Application of this Model  = ablitity to detect a faulty wafer using sensor data on a wafer production industry" 

"                             ,by using this model client will automatically knows a detailed information of their sensor quality " 
"                             ,so they are easily knows faulty and a good one instead of cheking all of them"

"Pros                       = Qality cheking time reduced to productivity increased , "

"Cons                       = Needs a proper and valid input"

"Tools used for this project= Pycharm,Flask,ML algorithm such as (KNN,Magic tree)"

"Input                      = sensor data from a client"

"Output                     = -1 if faulty or 1 if Good "

"Setup in local machine     = Need to install Pycharm IDE and run this model starts with requirement.txt"
